== Emails for testing

Purpose: test some aspects of the pop3 implementation {{{flyingrat}}}.

* {{{test-7bit.mbox}}}, created by Outlook 2010 on Windows 7,
  saved to mbox by flyingrat v0.2.0 with Python2.7 on Windows.

This is a base test as the email is very simple.

* {{{test-8bit-latin1.mbox}}} created with mutt,
  saved to mbox with Kontact e35 on Debian, some headers edited
* {{{test-8bit-utf8.mbox}}}, created
  by copying and editing {{{test-8bit-latin1.mbox}}}

Both 8bit test mails require that reading from file and transfering
conserves the bytes, thus this Python2.7 type 'str' (aka 'binary' is used).

* {{{test-7bit-bytestuffing.mbox}}},
  copied and edited from the simple test mail.

Tests the byte-stuffing per line which is necessary for POP3
for each line that starts with a dot.

=== Examples
{{{
cat test-mails/*.mbox >inbox.mbox
}}}
